**WARNING: MAIL FUNNEL IS STILL IN ALPHA. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION.**

Are you tired of your e-mail addresses receiving spam (and not knowing who leaked your e-mail address)? Are done being denied service because your beloved disposable e-mail service was abused by criminals?

Then, Mail Funnel may be right for you. With Mail Funnel, you can easily subscribe to any website or service using a unique e-mail address under your own domain name. Since it's your own domain name, no provider will refuse you service, but any spam is easily traced back to a specific e-mail address and subsequently blocked.
